# Merge-Sort
Algorithms

Split into individual elements by successively(recursively) splitting lists into two. <div>
following divide and conquer <div>
  split & merge (sorting)<div>
 1. If n=1, done. (no need to sort)<div>
 2. Recursively sort (1~n/2) & (n/2 +1 ~ n) <div>
 3. Merge two sorted lists<div><div>
  
  Time Complexity : O (n logn)
